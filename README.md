# Carter Karinshak's Website Repository

## Purpose
The purpose of this repository is to house the information for my personal website. On this website users may find information about myself, some of the work I've completed at Lehigh, and some of the jobs I've held or will hold in the future. Along with this information are links to my resume and LinkedIn so that visitors may learn more about me. Visitors to this page should be redirected to https://cartertk223.github.io/
