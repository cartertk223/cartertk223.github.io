_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify sentiment](report/report.md)**_

This link will lead you to my midterm project that I worked on in one of my classes during my time at Lehigh. During this project, I got to apply many of the python skills that I had learned and apply them to a real world situation. In this case specifically, I used 10-Ks from S&P 500 companies and measured their overall sentiment to determine whether or not the verbiage within a 10-K could be observed to have a correlation with stock returns. This project proved to be incredibly comprehensive and gave me an incredible opportunity to truly apply the skills I had learned in class in a real world scenario. Overall, the project was a great success and I was able to document some interesting findings that I came across during my work in this file.

_**Internship at Comcast**_

During the summer of 2021 I had the opportunity to join the Investor Relations team at Comcast Corporation. This was an incredible experience where I had the great privilege to work with and learn from so many great leaders at one of the biggest companies in the world. Some of my responsibilities in my role included: 
- Assisted in putting together multiple internal financial documents, such as LRPs, and distributed them to executives across the company. Also performed research for executives on competitors with a focus on streaming services.
- Created a PowerPoint presentation summarizing the financials of peer companies which I presented to the SVP of Investor Relations. Based on the success of the presentation, it was later distributed to several executives across the company.
- Attended competitorsâ€™ earnings calls and would compile summary documents concerning their financial releases which were distributed to members of the Investor Relations team.
- Created an Excel file to track the movements of key peer stocks and distribute market information in a daily email to members of the Investor Relations team. Also helped finalize and distribute internal company-wide memos following important events such as Investor Days for competitors.
