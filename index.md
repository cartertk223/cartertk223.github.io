_**[Natural language processing 10-Ks to identify sentiment](report/report.md)**_

This link will lead you to my midterm project that I worked on in one of my classes during my time at Lehigh. During this project, I got to apply many of the python skills that I had learned and apply them to a real world situation. In this case specifically, I used 10-Ks from S&P 500 companies and measured their overall sentiment to determine whether or not the verbiage within a 10-K could be observed to have a correlation with stock returns. This project proved to be incredibly comprehensive and gave me an incredible opportunity to truly apply the skills I had learned in class in a real world scenario. Overall, the project was a great success and I was able to document some interesting findings that I came across during my work in this file.
